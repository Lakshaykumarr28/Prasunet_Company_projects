Prasunet Machine Learning Internship Projects Overview

These projects were developed as part of the Prasunet Company Machine Learning Internship program. During the internship, I had the opportunity to work on several exciting machine learning tasks, enhancing my skills in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep learning and web-based deployment of AI models.

Below are brief descriptions of the two main tasks I worked on:

Project 1: Prasunet_ML_01
Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
